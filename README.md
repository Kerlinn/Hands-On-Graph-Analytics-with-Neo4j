This is the code repository for [Hands-On Graph Analytics with Neo4j](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-graph-analytics-with-neo4j/9781839212611), published by Packt.

**Perform graph processing and visualization techniques using connected data across your enterprise**

## What is this book about?
Neo4j is a graph database that includes plugins to run complex graph algorithms.
The book starts with an introduction to the basics of graph analytics, the Cypher query language, and graph architecture components, and helps you to understand why enterprises have started to adopt graph analytics within their organizations. You’ll find out how to implement Neo4j algorithms and techniques and explore various graph analytics methods to reveal complex relationships in your data. You’ll be able to implement graph analytics catering to different domains such as fraud detection, graph-based search, recommendation systems, social networking, and data management. You’ll also learn how to store data in graph databases and extract valuable insights from it. As you become well-versed with the techniques, you’ll discover graph machine learning in order to address simple to complex challenges using Neo4j. You will also understand how to use graph data in a machine learning model in order to make predictions based on your data. Finally, you’ll get to grips with structuring a web application for production using Neo4j.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Become well-versed with Neo4j graph database building blocks, nodes, and relationships
* Discover how to create, update, and delete nodes and relationships using Cypher querying
* Use graphs to improve web search and recommendations
* Understand graph algorithms such as pathfinding, spatial search, centrality, and community detection
* Find out different steps to integrate graphs in a normal machine learning pipeline
